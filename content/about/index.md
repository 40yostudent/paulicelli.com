# About Me

Hi! I’m a MacOS, iOS, and formerly windows, support advisor and technician with more than 20 years of experience on the field.

I love to learn and study and my passion is the Computer Science. I’m self-taught developer with strong experience in C, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Swift, and in 2019 I started studying Computer Science at Bicocca University.

The work environment I dream about is physical or remote, showing noticeable diversity, human values, tight teamwork, friendship, open feedback, oriented toward new technologies.
